### Setting up the remote Server

(these notes are currently incomplete)

-   Tested using Ubuntu 21.04

-   Check homedir permissions - should be set correctly on 21.04, but not on earlier versions. Don't want to be able to access others' home dir.

-   Install Packrat as root from CRAN

-   Dependencies for Tidyverse: `sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev` (from <https://blog.zenggyu.com/en/post/2018-01-29/installing-r-r-packages-e-g-tidyverse-and-rstudio-on-ubuntu-linux/>)

-   Other development libraries we're likely to need: library deb name (package needed for)

    -   libfontconfig1-dev (freetype)

    -   libcairo2-dev (cairo)

    -   libudunits2-dev (units (sf dependency))

    -   libgdal-dev (sf)

-   Will need to set http_proxy and https_proxy for downloading packages on RVM

(Library dependencies - this could get quite complicated - see: <https://github.com/rstudio/r-system-requirements> <https://github.com/r-hub/sysreqsdb> for two (different) databases of OS package dependencies for R libraries. `getdeps.R` will produce a (draft) apt install line for a given set of packages)

### Server notes - Ubuntu 20.04

Using Ubuntu 20.04

Install system libraries for common packages (The following covers the packages installed on the standard desktop image - had to tweak tcl and libopenmpi versions from autogenerated), plus dependencies needed for systemPipeShiny (which we use for testing, as it's complicated with lots of dependencies):

    sudo apt install pandoc pandoc-citeproc libssl-dev libxml2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libcairo2 libcairo2-dev git-core zlib1g-dev jags default-jre-headless libopenmpi3 libopenmpi-dev libomp-dev make libgit2-dev libssh2-1-dev libgmp10 libgmp-dev libglpk-dev libpng-dev python gdal-bin libproj-dev libgdal-dev libmpfr-dev libgeos-dev libgeos++-dev libsodium-dev libicu-dev tcl8.6 tk8.6 tk-table libudunits2-dev libv8-dev librsvg2-dev libssh-dev

Install R following instructions at <https://docs.rstudio.com/resources/install-r/> (I went with most recent version (4.1.1 at time of writing). Note `r-base` with Ubuntu 20.04 is very old, so don't use Ubuntu provided packages. Set up the symlinks as described on that page.

Start R as root, and install shiny, rmarkdown, devtools and packrat packages:

`sudo R`

`install.packages(c("shiny", "rmarkdown", "packrat", "devtools"))`

`q()`

Install Shiny server (<https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/download-server/ubuntu/>), e.g.:

(check you're getting latest version of Shiny Server - note URL is ubuntu-14.04, even though we're using 20.04)

    sudo apt-get install gdebi-core
    wget https://download3.rstudio.org/ubuntu-14.04/x86_64/shiny-server-1.5.16.958-amd64.deb
    sudo gdebi shiny-server-1.5.16.958-amd64.deb

Check Shiny server is working correctly - go to <http://server:3838>, and check the Shiny and RMarkdown apps appear in frames on the right hand side.

Setup timezone on the server

`sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata`

Edit `/etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf`:

    # Instruct Shiny Server to run applications as the user "shiny"
    run_as shiny;

    # Define a server that listens on port 3838 on localhost
    server {
      listen 3838 127.0.0.1;


      location / {
        run_as :HOME_USER:;
        user_dirs;
        directory_index off;
      }

    }

Restart Shiny Server `sudo service shiny-server restart`

Make it so that user's cannot read others' home directories (<https://superuser.com/a/615990>): update `DIR_MODE` to `DIR_MODE=0750` in `/etc/adduser.conf` and change permissions on any existing homedirs.

(ShinyServer "su"s to the user when serving apps from `~/ShinyApps`, so this will still work)

Add users with `adduser`

### Nginx

Modify `location /` of `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` to:

```
        location / {
                # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
#               try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3838/;
                proxy_redirect http://127.0.0.1:3838/ $scheme://$host/;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;

                # $http_upgrade and $connection_upgrade are set up
                # in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
                proxy_read_timeout 20d;
                proxy_buffering off;
        }

```

Add the following to the `http` section of `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`:


```
        # For Shiny proxy
          map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
            default upgrade;
            ''      close;
        }


```

TODO: Set up https once we have certificate

### Shinyproxy notes (very incomplete)

This section contains notes and thoughts about how we might switch to a Shinyproxy based setup. This would provide better scaling for apps, since each user gets their own copy in its own Dockerised instance.

Published apps need to be added to `application.yml` and the server restarted. This causes all current users sessions to be ended. <https://shinyproxy.io/documentation/configuration/#session-persistence> suggests we can keep the sessions open using Redis (unclear what happens during the \~20 seconds the Shinyproxy is restarting and we get a 502 error)

If we go down this route, we'd probably want to mount /home as /home in Docker container (how to handle permissions???) so the Packrat libraries are available (and in the same place within and without the container)
