# shinysender

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The aim of this package is to provide a Shiny app to allow (authenticated) users to send their Shiny apps to a remote Shiny Server.

## Notes

User authentication will be handled by Shinyproxy.

Initially:

-   Will serve \~/ShinyApps only

-   Setup of users' accounts on remote Shiny server is out of scope (though will do this eventually)
